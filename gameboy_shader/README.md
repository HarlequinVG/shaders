Gameboy Shader for RetroArch
=======
Download the files keeping the directory structure intact. Load the gb_shader.cgp file found in the /gameboy_shader/
directory to apply the shader. Under RetroArch's video settings, ensure that video driver is set to OpenGL, integer
scaling is selected, and that aspect ratio is set to auto.

Palette and background images can be changes by editing or replacing the associated files found in the 
/gameboy_shader/resources/ directory. Various other settings can be changed by directly editing variables listed under
the config header in the shader files found in the /gameboy_shader/shader_files/ directory.

This is an early version of the shader which is still under development.
